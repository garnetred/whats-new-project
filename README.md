# Abstract

This application is a news website that has multiple sections and allows users to search articles via keywords. 

## Tools

This application was built using React.js (via `create-react-app`), HTML, and CSS. I used the Jest testing framework along with React Testing Library and DOM Testing Library in order to test each component. I created a low-fidelity wireframe, mockup, and prototype using Figma. For accessibility, I relied on the accessibility audit available in the Chrome Developer Tools and the A11y Contrast Checker plugin for Figma.

I created the above mockup using Figma based on similar websites such as Google News.
